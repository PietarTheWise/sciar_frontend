    <h1>Augmented Reality</h1>
    <p>
      Sciar’s Augmented Reality Guide helps even the newest member of your staff
      to perform to your standards, work the most efficient way and find the
      reagents and samples.
      <br />
      <br />
      Step by step instructions are nearly impossible to skip and the camera on
      the device makes it easy to take notes and read machine-readable text and
      numbers to save for the documentation.
      <br />
      <br />

      The AR headsets can also be used for remote guidance where instructions
      can be drawn directly onto the worker’s field of vision.

      The combination of the headset camera, machine intelligence and our
      digital models for your processes makes it possible to generate automatic,
      detailed and comprehensive documentation that makes replication easy with
      Sciar software.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sciar’s Holistic Laboratory Management System shows you a dashboard of all
      your projects and they become easy to manage on our Web User Interface.
      Head of Laboratory can also easily track reagent consumption, the progress
      of different projects and free resources

    <h1>Sciar Vault</h1>
    <p>
      Once our system generates automatic documentation, it is clear that you
      want the best place to store it. That place is Sciar Vault. Our
      cloud-based home for all your research data is protected from
      cybersecurity attacks and data loss.
      <br />
      <br />

      The product features also prevent any data from being altered afterward
      without it leaving an audit trail and the original data is securely
      stored. Inside your vault, you can access your data and analyze it. An
      easy way to gain insight into your research and business operations.

      Our system gets to know you. It becomes your personal assistant and it can

      your friend. It can give you insight into your work and results.

    <h1>Reagent & Sample management</h1>
    <p>
      A lot of time can be wasted when searching for the correct sample or a
      reagent that a colleague has moved. Sometimes a reagent can be forgotten
      at room temperature after the experiment. The labels on different
      containers can be unclear or have only partial information.
      <br />
      <br />
      These are problems that Sciar’s Sample & Reagent Manager can remove from
      your laboratory. Each sample gets a sticker when used in the workflow and
      its unique ID contains all the information such as the date the reagent
      was first opened and all the processes it was used in. It can also guide
      you to the correct freezer and correct box containing the sample. This can
      be especially useful with new employees!
